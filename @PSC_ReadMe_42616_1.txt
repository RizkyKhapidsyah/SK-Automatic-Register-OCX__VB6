Title: _**Automatically register OCXs/DLLs
Description: Use this code to automatically copy and enregister custom OCX on target machines, given names and classes on an INI file. Checks previous registration info in the Registry before re-registering. Well suited for setup routines that need custom controls, as a preloader, as it supports loading other program after program completion.
